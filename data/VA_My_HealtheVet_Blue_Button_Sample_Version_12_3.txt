Tests: 
1) Transthoracic ECHOcardiogram

Impressions
Mild LVH with significantly reduced LV systolic function. EF visually 
estimated to be 25%.

Summary
A). Indication: Assess left ventricular function. Assess left ventricular 
ejection fraction.
B). Left ventricle: The ventricle was mildly dilated. Systolic function 
was moderately to markedly reduced. Ejection fraction was estimated to be 25 
%. This study was inadequate for the evaluation of regional wall motion. 
Wall thickness was mildly increased. There was mild concentric hypertrophy.
 
2) ECG
EKG showed 4 mm ST elevation in inferior leads. 
New left axis deviation and inverted T-waves in V3-6 were found.
 
3) Cardiac catherization.
No significant coronary disease noted.
 
Reason for Admission:
 
Patient is 71yo with a history of poorly controlled DM and 
HTN who presented to the ED today with a 5 day history of worsening chest 
pain and shortness of breath with associated dyspnea at rest, PND, and 
orthopnea. Patient reports that beginning 5 days ago experienced a 
feeling of anxiety while laying in bed.   Patient had difficulty 
breathing and chest became tight.  Patient sat up in bed and the feeling 
eased. Since then pateint has had intermittent feelings of pressure, 
patient had resistance on his chest while lying down.  Patient feels like 
he can't catch his breath.  Patient reports R shoulder cramping, left 
lower chest pain. These episodes vary in length of time, but the 
shortness of breath lasts all day. Patient reports thinking the symptoms 
are associated with his taking metoprolol. In the ED the patient sats 
were 88 while lying down. Patient was given lasix and after a while the 
feeling of fullness in chest dissipated. Other associated symptoms: + 
chest pain, duration longer than 10 minutes, + chest pressure, heavy 
quality + discomfort, neck or jaw or shoulder or arm. At last admission 
had metoprolol for his BP control.Patient was admitted to r/o ischemic event. 
 
Hospital Course: 
1) Chest pain: Patient was ruled in for an ischemic event with positive 
serial cardiac enzymes and noted ST elevation. Additionally, new left axis 
deviation and inverted T-waves in V3-6 were found. Patient had persistent 
but finally resolved chest pain over his admission. Cardiac catheterization 
done this admission did not reveal any significant coronary disease.  In 
2003, pt was found to have non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF 
of 35-40% on GXT and Echo. Pt had TTE on 3/12/07 showing an EF of 25%. Pt 
SOB continued to improve with Lasix.  Sublingual nitroglycerin was also 
provided to patient.
 
2) Shortness of breath/Non-ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Patient has 
known EF of 35%. Echo done today to determine if EF is preserved and had 
decreased to 25%.  CXR and symptoms consistent with CHF that improved 
with diuresis.   Patient was started on Lasix IV which bumped his Cr from 
1.2 to 1.5. Lasix was converted to po. Weight counseling provided for CHF;  
patient has a scale at home.
 
3) Hypertension: Patient has controlled hypertension. On last admission, 
pt was prescribed Metoprolol.  B/P during this admission and prior to this 
admission are well controlled.  Will continue patient on Metoprolol at 
discharge.   
 
4) Uncontrolled DM II: Patient continues to have glucose fingersticks in 
150s-175s. Patient is receiving metformin to control diabetes.  Patient 
is compliant with performing and recording his sugars at home.  Spoke in 
great depth about the negative consequence of  persistently elevated 
blood glucose levels with the patient.  Patient agrees to follow diabetic 
management instructions at home.
 
Disposition:  Patient is being discharged to home today in good 
condition.  Patient has follow-up arranged in the Cardiology clinic.

Reference Range: (>60)
Interpretation: An eGFR <60 is abnormal.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) results >60 are imprecise.
Many variables affect the calculated result.
Interpretation of eGFR results >60 must be monitored over time.
Units are mL/min/1.73m^2.
